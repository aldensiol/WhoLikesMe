# WhoLikesMe?

## Description

This Chrome extension allows free users of OKCupid to view who likes them within the "Likes" tab. I created this project to delve into learning JavaScript and API endpoints in depth, as well as to gain a surface-level understanding of Chrome extension creation. This extension is the result of my journey into web development and is designed to enhance the user experience of OKCupid by providing a feature that is normally locked behind a paywall.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to challenge myself with a real-world application of JavaScript and to understand the intricacies of working with API endpoints. Additionally, I wanted to explore the process of creating a Chrome extension, from conception to deployment. This project served as a hands-on learning experience to deepen my knowledge of web technologies and to solve a specific problem faced by many users of OKCupid (including myself, lmao)
